## intent.md

Located at `.forge/state/recipes/{id}/intent.md`. Markdown format:

Status: EXPLORING | CONFIRMED

## Problem
{pain point or gap}

## Purpose
{why this needs to exist}

## Users
{who and their context}

## Success Criteria
{measurable outcomes}

## Direction
{agreed path forward}

## Key Decisions
- {decision with reasoning}

## Research Notes
{findings from investigation}
```

Status transitions: EXPLORING → CONFIRMED (mutual agreement).
Updated incrementally during discovery conversation.

## vision.md

Located at `.forge/state/vision.md`. Markdown format:

```markdown
# Vision: {product name}

Status: DRAFT | CONFIRMED
Created: {ISO8601}
Updated: {ISO8601}

## Purpose
{What is being built and why}

## Users
{Who will use this}

## Core Components
- {Component}: {role}

## Technical Constraints
- {constraint}

## Success Criteria
- {criterion}
```

Status transitions: DRAFT → CONFIRMED (user confirms).
Updated when direction changes — always re-confirm after edits.

## roadmap.md

Located at `.forge/state/roadmap.md`. Markdown format:

```markdown
# Roadmap: {product name}

Status: DRAFT | CONFIRMED
Progress: {done}/{total}

## Items

- [x] {description} (recipe: {recipe-id})
- [ ] {description}
- [-] {description} (skipped: {reason})
```

Checkbox convention: `[x]` done, `[ ]` pending, `[-]` skipped.
Active items get `(recipe: {id})` annotation when a recipe starts.
Go code counts checkboxes for progress hints — no complex parsing needed.

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **Use exact field names** as shown above. `"time"` not `"timestamp"`. `"decided"` not `"status"`.
2. **`conclusion` is a string**, not an object. Write structured conclusions as a single sentence.
3. **`documents` in manifest is a flat map** where keys are file paths and values are DocumentEntry objects. Not categorized lists.
4. **Always run `forge validate` after creating/modifying any JSON file in `.forge/`.**
5. **Always create `recipe.json`** at the start of a recipe. This is how `forge recipe status` finds the active recipe.
