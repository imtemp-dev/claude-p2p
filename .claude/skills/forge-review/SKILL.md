# Code Review

Review code for: $ARGUMENTS

## Settings

Read `.forge/config/settings.yaml`. If `agents.reviewer_quality`, `agents.reviewer_security`,
or `agents.reviewer_arch` are set, pass those models when spawning the corresponding agents.

## Step 1: Determine Review Mode

Parse $ARGUMENTS:
- If first word is `security`, `performance`, or `patterns` → **focused mode**
  Remaining words = file scope (or all if empty)
- Otherwise → **full mode** (all perspectives), arguments = file scope

## Step 2: Identify Scope and Context

**File scope:**
If inside a recipe (tasks.json exists):
- Read tasks.json for the list of implemented files
- If test-results.json exists, also include files from `test_files` in scope.
  Test code quality matters: correct assertions, realistic mocks, test isolation.
- If file scope given → filter to matching files
- If no scope → review all files from tasks.json + test files

If inside a recipe but no tasks.json (fix recipe):
- Read fix-spec.md "Changes" section for file paths
- If no fix-spec.md → fall back to git diff

If standalone (no recipe):
- If file scope given → review those files/directories
- If no scope → try `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` to detect recently changed files.
  If changes found, propose reviewing those files.
  If no git or no changes, ask user which files to review.

**Architecture context:**
- Read `.forge/state/project-map.md` for layer structure
- Read `.forge/state/layers/{name}.md` for the relevant layer's patterns
- If inside a recipe, read final.md for design intent
- Pass this context to the architecture agent

## Step 3: Multi-Perspective Review

### Full Mode (no category — default)

Spawn all 3 agents **in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls** to ensure
true parallel execution. Do NOT spawn them sequentially.
The default perspectives are quality, security, and architecture, but adapt
if the code warrants different emphasis (e.g., performance-critical code may
need a performance perspective instead of or in addition to security):

1. **Agent(reviewer-quality)**: Code quality — correctness, error handling,
   resource management, maintainability.
   If the spec (final.md) contains mermaid flow diagrams, compare the code's
   actual control flow against the spec's expected flow. Flag deviations.

2. **Agent(reviewer-security)**: Security — input validation, authentication,
   data protection, common vulnerability patterns

3. **Agent(reviewer-arch)**: Architecture — alignment with project structure
   (project-map.md, layers), naming conventions, pattern consistency.
   Include project-map.md and layers content in the agent prompt.

Each agent produces a numbered list of findings with severity tags.

### Focused Mode

| Category | Agent(s) | Focus |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `security` | reviewer-security only | Deep security analysis |
| `performance` | reviewer-quality | Performance focus: N+1 queries, memory, blocking I/O, algorithm complexity |
| `patterns` | reviewer-arch | Pattern focus: conventions, structure, consistency |

For focused mode, give the single agent a deeper, more thorough prompt
for its specific domain rather than a broad scan.

## Step 4: Synthesize and Assess Practicality

After collecting findings from all agents:

1. **Deduplicate**: Same issue found by multiple agents → merge, note all perspectives
2. **Reclassify severity**: With full context, some findings may be more or less severe
3. **Practical assessment** for each finding:
   - Will this actually cause a bug in production?
   - Is this a real security risk or purely theoretical?
   - Is fixing this worth the effort vs the risk?
   - Tag: **[ACTIONABLE]** (should fix) vs **[INFORMATIONAL]** (good to know)

## Step 5: Generate Report

Save to `.forge/state/recipes/{id}/review.md` if inside a recipe.
Otherwise output directly to user.

```markdown
# Code Review: {scope}

Generated: {ISO8601}
Recipe: {id} (if applicable)
Mode: {full|security|performance|patterns}
Perspectives: {quality + security + architecture | single agent}

## Summary
- Critical: N (N actionable)
- Major: N (N actionable)
- Minor: N
- Info: N

## Critical — Actionable
1. [CRT-001] **{title}** in `{file}:{line}`
   Found by: {agent name}
   Practical: {HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW} — {why}
   {code context}
   → {fix suggestion}

### Major — Actionable
...

### Minor
...

### Informational (non-actionable)
...
```

Log if inside recipe:
```bash
forge recipe log {id} --action review --output review.md --result "N critical, N major (N actionable)"
```

Review is a **mandatory step** in implement and fix flows.
[ACTIONABLE] critical/major items should be fixed before proceeding.
