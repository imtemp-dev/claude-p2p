# Recipe: Debug

Debug through multi-perspective analysis: $ARGUMENTS

## Context Briefing

Before starting:
1. List `.forge/state/recipes/` → find related recipes (especially the one
   that built the affected code)
2. Set `ref_recipe` in recipe.json to the most relevant recipe ID
3. Read related recipe's final.md → original design intent
4. Check deviation.md → known spec-code differences
5. Check review.md from related recipes → quality issues that may be related
6. Scan codebase for files likely related to the symptom
7. If `.forge/state/roadmap.md` exists, read it for project context
   (what's been built, what's planned — helps understand system boundaries)

## Resume Check

```bash
forge recipe status
```
If active debug recipe found, read perspectives.md and draft.md to resume.

If no active recipe, create one:
```bash
forge recipe create --type debug --topic "$ARGUMENTS"
```
Use the output as recipe ID for all subsequent commands.

## Step 1: Collect Perspectives

Read `.forge/config/settings.yaml` for project-specific limits.

Investigate the symptom from `debug.perspective_count` (default: 6) angles. Create
`.forge/state/recipes/{id}/perspectives.md`:

### 1.1 Data Flow Map
Trace the complete path of the failing operation:
- Request/input → processing steps → output/response
- At each step: what data enters, what transforms, what exits
- Mark where the flow breaks or produces wrong results

### 1.2 Dependency Graph
Map all modules/functions involved in the failing path:
- Which module calls which
- External dependencies (libraries, APIs, DB)
- Configuration dependencies (env vars, config files)
- Identify any recently changed dependencies

### 1.3 Design Intent
Read `.forge/state/project-map.md` for the layer overview.
Load the affected layer's detail from `.forge/state/layers/{name}.md`.
Then read the specific recipe's final.md (via ref_recipe) for
detailed design of the affected feature.
- project-map.md: what layers exist, how they connect
- layers/{name}.md: specific layer's structure, models, APIs
- final.md: specific feature's intended behavior
- Where does actual behavior diverge from the design?

### 1.4 Runtime Context
Check the execution environment:
- Environment variables and configuration values
- Database state (schema, data that might cause issues)
- External service availability and connectivity
- Version mismatches (installed vs expected)

### 1.5 Change History
```bash
git log --oneline -20
git log --all --oneline -- [affected files]
```
- What changed recently in the affected area?
- When did the symptom first appear?
- Correlate timing: symptom start ↔ code changes

### 1.6 Impact Map
- What other features share code with the affected area?
- If we fix this, what else could be affected?
- Upstream and downstream dependencies of the failing module

```bash
forge recipe log {id} --phase research --action research --output perspectives.md --result "6 perspectives collected"
```

## Step 2: Cross-Reference

Add a "Cross-Reference Analysis" section to perspectives.md:

For each pair of perspectives, check for inconsistencies:
- Design says X, but code does Y
- Config expects format A, but env provides format B
- Code changed at time T, symptom started at time T
- Dependency version X expects API Y, but we call Z

Produce ranked hypotheses:

```markdown
## Hypotheses (ranked by evidence strength)

1. [HIGH] {hypothesis} — supported by perspectives {list}
   Evidence: {specific cross-reference findings}

2. [MEDIUM] {hypothesis} — supported by perspectives {list}
   Evidence: {specific cross-reference findings}

3. [LOW] {hypothesis} — single perspective only
```

## Step 3: Draft Fix Spec

Based on the top hypothesis, create `.forge/state/recipes/{id}/draft.md`:

```markdown
# Debug Fix: {symptom}

Recipe: {id}
Ref: r-XXXX (original recipe)
Root Cause: {from cross-reference analysis}

## Evidence
- [Perspective 1.X]: {finding}
- [Perspective 1.Y]: {finding}
- Cross-reference: {inconsistency that proves the cause}

## Changes
For each file to modify:

### {file path}
- **Function**: {name}
- **Current behavior**: {what it does now (wrong)}
- **Fixed behavior**: {what it should do (correct)}
- **Code change**: {specific code modification}
- **Rationale**: {why this fixes the root cause}

## Edge Cases
- {edge case 1}: {how the fix handles it}

## Test Scenarios
- {scenario reproducing the original bug → now passes}
- {regression scenario → still works}
- {edge case scenario → handled correctly}
```

Apply **Draft Self-Check** before saving (same checklist as blueprint).

```bash
forge recipe log {id} --phase draft --action draft --output draft.md
```

## Step 4: Simulate

Use Skill("forge-simulate") on draft.md:
- Does the fix resolve the original symptom?
- Does it handle all evidence from perspectives?
- Does it break anything identified in the impact map (perspective 1.6)?

If gaps found → Edit draft.md → /verify → re-simulate.

## Step 5: Expert Review (1 round)

Run a focused 1-round debate on draft.md.
Choose 3 experts matching the relevant perspectives:
- e.g., Security Expert (if auth-related), Data Expert (if DB-related),
  Ops Expert (if config/runtime-related)

1 round only: each expert states their assessment.
- Is the root cause correctly identified?
- Is the fix complete?
- Are there risks the perspectives missed?

If experts disagree on root cause → ask user for decision.

```bash
forge recipe log {id} --phase debate --action debate --result "{consensus}"
```

## Step 6: Verify Loop

Run /forge-verify on the current draft:
- Is the fix logically sound?
- Does it contradict the original design (final.md)?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Does the evidence support the conclusion?

If issues found → Edit draft.md → re-verify.
Max `verify.max_iterations` (default: 3) → [CONVERGENCE FAILED] → ask user.

```bash
forge recipe log {id} --phase verify --action verify
```

Record verify results to verify-log (required for stop hook DONE gate):
```bash
forge recipe log {id} --iteration N --critical X --major Y --minor Z
```

## Step 7: Finalize

When verify shows critical=0, major=0:
1. Copy `draft.md` to `final.md`
2. Run Skill("forge-status") with arguments: {id}
3. Output `<forge>DONE</forge>`

Stop hook validates verify-log → phase=finalize.

## Next: Implement

After finalization, the debug recipe has produced a verified `final.md`.
Use the standard implement flow:

```
/forge-implement {id}
```

This reuses the entire implement infrastructure:
- Task decomposition from final.md
- Build loop with verification
- Test (existing + regression from Test Scenarios)
- Sync (spec ↔ code)
- Status → Complete
